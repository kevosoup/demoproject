All `~/global/*.scss` for core styles and base of components:

* `00-settings.scss` -  Global variables, config switches
* `01-tools.scss` - Default mixin and functions
* `02-generic.scss` - Ground-zero styles (normalize, resets, box-sizing)
* `03-elements.scss` - Unclassed HTML elements (Type selectors)
* `04-objects.scss` - Cosmetic-free design patterns, primarily structual components
* `04-trumps.scss` - Utility helper classes to extend and override styles of designed components


Follows methodology of ITCSS and each "layer" consists of Sass partials. It is recommended to make partials as specific as possible to allow for more easy of control.
